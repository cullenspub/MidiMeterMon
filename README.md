Using DPF to create plugins for monitoring audio and midi events. <br/>

This is a learning project that may develope into a serious effort if time permits :wink:<br/>

DPF is designed to make development of new plugins an easy and enjoyable task.<br/>
It allows developers to create plugins with custom UIs using a simple C++ API.<br/>
The framework facilitates exporting various different plugin formats from the same code-base.<br/>
